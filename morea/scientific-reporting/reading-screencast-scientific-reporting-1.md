# Markdown 
A Markdown editor is an intuitive and low-threshold text editing tool. 
The goal is to create content with a few formatting instructions that are set as tags in the text, so that it is easy to read and at the same time has an appealing and elaborate layout. Furthermore, the Markdown format allows the arbitrary creation of all common output formats. Text can be translated into web-based, electronically published or conventional print-based output formats. Especially for efficient and appealing communication on the web and the generation of well readable print texts it is an ingenious little helper. 
 
## Markdown Editors

### RStudio
Before the course background - r-spatial- is the preferred "editor" RStudio. It offers all functionalities for Markdown and additionally [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to automatically integrate evaluations scripts and images. at the same time it is directly connectable to github and from my point of view the best tool for such a combined way of working.

### Online Editors
Most recomended for occasional use are online Markdown editors. My personal ranking:

1. [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/)
1. [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/)
1. [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/)
